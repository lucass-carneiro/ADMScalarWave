## Purpose
Evolves the Klein-Gordon equation on top of an arbitrary background, without taking into account the geometry's back-reaction and thus having a field with null contribution to the energy-momentum tensor. This thorn is compatible with the [Carpet](https://bitbucket.org/eschnett/carpet/src/master/) AMR infrastructure. The implementation is based on Eq.s (A3c) and (A3d) of [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06118.pdf).
