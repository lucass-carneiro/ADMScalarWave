## Purpose
Evolves the Klein-Gordon equation on top of an arbitrary background, without taking into account the geometry's back-reaction and thus having a field with null contribution to the energy-momentum tensor. This thorn is compatible with the [CarpetX](https://bitbucket.org/eschnett/cactusamrex/src/master/) AMR infrastructure using CPU kernels. The implamentation is based on Eq.s (A3c) and (A3d) of [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06118.pdf).
